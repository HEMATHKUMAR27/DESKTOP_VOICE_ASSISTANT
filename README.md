Voice Assistant using Python üé§üßê

A simple and interactive Voice Assistant built using Python that performs various tasks based on voice commands. This project leverages Python libraries for speech recognition, text-to-speech, and automation to create a basic yet functional assistant.

Features:

*Play Songs üéµ: Plays your favorite songs on YouTube when you say commands like "Play [song name]."

*Tell Time ‚è∞: Provides the current time when asked, e.g., "What is the time?"

*Search Information üîç: Fetches brief summaries from Wikipedia for queries like "Who is [person's name]?"

*Open Websites üåê: Opens Google or performs a web search based on your command.

*Interactive Responses üó£Ô∏è: Uses text-to-speech to provide vocal feedback.

Technologies Used:

Python Libraries

*speech_recognition: Captures and recognizes voice commands.

*pyttsx3: Converts text to speech for interactive responses.

*pywhatkit: Automates tasks like playing YouTube videos.

*datetime: Retrieves and formats the current time.

*wikipedia: Fetches summaries from Wikipedia.

*webbrowser: Opens web pages or performs Google searches.

How It Works:

1.The program listens for your voice commands via a connected microphone.

2.It processes and recognizes the commands using the speech_recognition library.

3.Based on the command, the assistant:

*Plays songs on YouTube.

*Tells the current time.

*Provides brief information from Wikipedia.

*Opens websites like Google or performs searches.

4.The assistant responds with vocal feedback using pyttsx3.
